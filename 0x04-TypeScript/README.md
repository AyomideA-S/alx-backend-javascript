## Introduction

TypeScript is a powerful tool for writing robust and maintainable JavaScript code. It adds optional static types, interfaces, and other features that help catch errors early and improve code quality.

## Projects

1. **Project 1**: Introduction to TypeScript
2. **Project 2**: Advanced TypeScript Features
3. **Project 3**: TypeScript with React

## Installation

To get started with TypeScript, you need to have Node.js and npm installed. Then, you can install TypeScript globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g typescript
```

## Usage

To compile TypeScript files to JavaScript, use the `tsc` command followed by the filename:

```bash
tsc filename.ts
```

You can also initialize a TypeScript project with a `tsconfig.json` file:

```bash
tsc --init
```
