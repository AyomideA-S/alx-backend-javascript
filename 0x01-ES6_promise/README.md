## Introduction

Promises are a modern way to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. They provide a cleaner, more intuitive way to work with asynchronous code compared to traditional callback functions.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the concept of Promises.
- Create and use Promises.
- Handle asynchronous operations using `.then()`, `.catch()`, and `.finally()`.
- Chain multiple Promises.
- Use `Promise.all()` and `Promise.race()`.

## Project Structure

- **0-promise.js**: Basic example of a Promise.
- **1-promise.js**: Handling resolved and rejected Promises.
- **2-promise.js**: Chaining Promises.
- **3-promise.js**: Using `Promise.all()`.
- **4-promise.js**: Using `Promise.race()`.
