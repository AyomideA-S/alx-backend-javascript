## Introduction

In this module, you will learn about ES6 classes, a syntactical sugar over JavaScript's existing prototype-based inheritance. ES6 classes provide a more intuitive and cleaner syntax for creating objects and dealing with inheritance.

## Project Structure

The directory structure is as follows:

```shell
/home/ayodele/Desktop/alx-backend-javascript/0x02-ES6_classes/
├── README.md
├── 0-classroom.js
├── 1-make_classrooms.js
├── 2-hbtn_course.js
└── tests/
    ├── 0-classroom.test.js
    ├── 1-make_classrooms.test.js
    └── 2-hbtn_course.test.js
```

## Getting Started

To get started with the exercises, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/alx-backend-javascript.git
cd alx-backend-javascript/0x02-ES6_classes
```

## Usage

Each JavaScript file in the root directory contains a specific exercise related to ES6 classes. You can run the files using Node.js:

```sh
node 0-classroom.js
```

To run the tests, use a testing framework like Jest:

```sh
npm install
npm test
```
